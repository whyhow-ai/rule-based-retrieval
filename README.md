The Rule-based Retrieval package is a Python package that enables you to create and manage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with advanced filtering capabilities. It seamlessly integrates with OpenAI for text generation and Pinecone for efficient vector database management.

# Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Pinecone, Milvus or Qdrant credentials

### Install from PyPI

You can install the package directly from PyPI using pip:

```shell
pip install rule-based-retrieval
```

### Install from GitHub

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and install the package:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:whyhow-ai/rule-based-retrieval.git
cd rule-based-retrieval
pip install .
```

### Developer Install

For a developer installation, use an editable install and include the development dependencies:

```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

For ZSH:

```shell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you want to install the package directly without explicitly cloning yourself
run

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/whyhow-ai/rule-based-retrieval
```

WhyHow.AI is building tools to help developers bring more determinism and control to their RAG pipelines using graph structures. If you're thinking about, in the process of, or have already incorporated knowledge graphs in RAG, weâ€™d love to chat at team@whyhow.ai, or follow our newsletter at [WhyHow.AI](https://www.whyhow.ai/).
